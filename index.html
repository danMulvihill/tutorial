                <h1>Web Development Tools</h1>
                <h4>Support tools for web developers</h4>

            <p>So you mastered JavaScript, CSS and HTML and now you are ready to start creating amazing web apps or beautiful 
                Websites, only to find out there are all these peripheral utilities like version control and
                build tools that you are expected to know as well. They are supposed to make things easier!? 
                This guide is kind of like a cheat sheet, pointing out the most important elements to master first, 
                and once you do, you can go back to real work. Hopefully this guide will make it easier for you. 
                I read a lot of documentation so you don't have to.

                    <p> One valuable tool is something embeded on every computer, the command line 
                        interface. Of course, almost everything you do in the CLI, you can also do with more user-friendly interfaces, 
                        like the file manager, but the CLI is faster (once you master it), more efficient, and it impresses
                        others who think you are doing something esoteric.

                    <p> One good reason to master the CLI is that many other tools work best in the CLI. One of those tools 
                        include version control. By far the most popular version control system is <a href = "https://git-scm.com">Git</a>. Git helps you keep
                        track of different version of your projects, and reverts to previous versions when you make a big mistake. 
                        Other version control systems include <a href= "https://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a> and <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org">mercurial</a>.

                        <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> is a large space on the Web that allows you to easily store your git repositories online.
                        Online collections of repositories like GitHub also allow teams of developers to work together, collaborate 
                        and share projects, in the spirit of open source software. Although GitHub is the largest and 
                        the most well-known of these services, there are others like <a href = "https://bitbucket.org">Bitbucket</a>.

                            Node.js is a programming envirnoment that, among other things,
                            provides a framework for development tools. You can download and run 
                            programs the directly on command line, or, more conveniently, you
                            can run files written in Nodejs.

                        Code editors are often the web developers most valuable assistant,
                        providing a wide range of services from color-coding and autofilling to
                        linting and providing easy access to documentation.  
                        Unlike version control and repositories, which are dominated by one major player (git and GitHub) and a few small players,
                        the brands of editors are more distributed. Although <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a> is close to becoming a favorite
                        (originally from GitHub, by the way), 
                        other brands include Abode's <a href="http://brackets.io">Brackets</a>, 
                        MicroSoft's Visual Studio <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Code</a>, 
                        <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a>, 
                        and the ancient cli tool <a href="http://www.vim.org">Vim</a>.
