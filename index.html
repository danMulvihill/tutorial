                    <p> In addition to HTML, CSS and JS, there are a variety of tools that a front-end developer are expected
                        to master, or at least know. One valuable tool is something embeded on every computer, the command line 
                        interface. Of course, almost everything you do in the CLI, you can also do with more user-friendly interfaces, 
                        like the file manager, but the CLI is faster (once you master it), more efficient, and it impresses
                        others who think you are doing something esoteric.

                    <p> One good reason to master the CLI is that many other tools work best in the CLI. One of those tools 
                        include version control. By far the most popular version control system is <a href = "https://git-scm.com">Git</a>. Git helps you keep
                        track of different version of your projects, and reverts to previous versions when you make a big mistake. 
                        Other version control systems include <a href= "https://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a> and <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org">mercurial</a>.

                        <a href="https://github.io">GitHub</a> is a large space on the Web that allows you to easily store your git repositories online.
                        Online collections of repositories like GitHub also allow teams of developers to work together, collaborate 
                        and share projects, in the spirit of open source software. Although GitHub is the largest and 
                        the most well-known of these services, there are others like <a href = "https://bitbucket.org">Bitbucket</a>.

                        Code editors are often the web developers most valuable assistant,
                        providing a wide range of services from color-coding and autofilling to
                        linting and providing easy access to documentation.  
                        Unlike version control and repositories, which are dominated by one major player (git and GitHub) and a few small players,
                        the brands of editors are more distributed. Although <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a> is close to becoming a favorite
                        (originally from GitHub, by the way), 
                        other brands include Abode's <a href="http://brackets.io">Brackets</a>, 
                        MicroSoft's Visual Studio <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Code</a>, 
                        <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a>, 
                        and the ancient cli tool <a href="http://www.vim.org">Vim</a>.
