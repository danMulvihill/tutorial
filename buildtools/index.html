            <h1>Node Automation Modules</h1>
            <p> Node is an environment built for using JavaScript on a computer's OS instead of within the browser.
                Most people think of it as JavaScript's server-side enviroment, but it's more than that. 
                Node comes equiped with a huge variety of command-line tools to help with front-end development. 
                There are automation modules in other programming language environements. <a href="https://getcomposer.org">Composer</a> is a package manager
                for PHP, for example, and Ruby has a healthy ecosystem of programs, but nobody comes close to NodeJS for 
                the amount of programs available.

                    <h2>Package Management</h2>
                </div>
                <section class="col col-2-3">
                    <p>When you download <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a> on to your computer, it comes with tool called 
                        Node Package Management or <a href="https://www.npmjs.com">npm</a>, although you can also install other package managers. 
                        One popular alternative is <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/">yarn</a>. Many people prefer yarn because it's better 
                        code orgainzation allows for faster or more efficient processing. 
                        <a href="https://bower.io">Bower</a> is another older package manager. 
                        npm, yarn, and other package managers work with a package.json file,
                        that acts as a kind of manifest of all the packages, or modules, and uses that manifest
                        to store and organized the modules in a directory. To start using npm,
                       find the package, or module, you want and install it on the command line with the
                       command <code>npm install [module-name]</code>. When you do this, it's creates a directory named modules, and puts all your modules in that directory, 
                       along with any dependencies included. You can, for example install <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery">jquery</a> with <code>npm install jquery</code>. 
                       Use the <code>npm init</code> command to create a package.json file.
                       There are two useful flags that saves it the package.json file, <code>--save</code> and <code>--save-dev</code>  </p>

                    <h2>Task Runners</h2>

                <section class="col col-2-3">
                    <p>Task runners help automate the development workflow by doing many 
                        reptitive and tedious tasks for you. For example, instead of cutting your css or javascript code
                        to paste into a minimizer, the tasker runner will do this with one command. 
                        You can add and combine tasks like browser refreshing and linting too.
                        <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp">Gulp</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt">Grunt</a> are the two most popular packages that are competing for most popular, 
                        although Gulp, the newer of two, seems to be gaining the upper hand.
                        Using Gulp can be a simple as calling a few methods in a single file, 
                        or it can be complex with multiple files that incorpate other packages like WebPack and development servers.
                        If you want easy, download or clone <a href="https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/v3.9.1/docs/getting-started.md">Gulp from GitHub</a> and follow the easy-to-use documentation provide there.</p>

                        <h2>Bundling</h2>
                    </div>
                    <section class="col col-2-3">
                        <p>CSS and JavaScript files are linked to HMTL pages with the standard link and script tags. You can provide more than
                            one script or link tag, but it is much more efficient and faster to bundle them all in one tag.
                            Bundling packages take all your scripts and put them into a single file.   By far the most well-loved package manager right now is <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack">WebPack</a>. 
                            WebPack will also help with running preprocessors and transpilers, and even some of the tasks handled by Gulp.
                            <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/browserify">Browserify</a> is another older bundler, but it's not a robust as WebPack.

                    <p>From the npm website, you can search or browse for packages or modules.
                        The terms package and module are used interchangable just to confuse you. 
                        They are exactly the same thing: a directory of files (or sub-directories) containing classes, objects and/or functions.
                         Everything on npm is a module. Gulp and grunt are modules; jQuery is a module; even npm is a module.
                        So far, most of the modules mentioned above are aggregate modules that combine tasks and even incorporate 
                       other modules to make tasks easier. You can get Gulp to run WebPack, for example.

                       There are other modules that specialize in one task. You can use these by themselves or incorpate them into task runner.</p> 
                       <p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server">Live-server</a> runs a development server for you that you may need to incorporate server-side code, make Ajax request, or get your cookies to work.</p>
                       <p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-sync">Browser-sync</a> began as a tool to test webpages across browswers, but has a wide array of other browser-related 
                           tasks like automatic reloading.
                       </p>
                       <p>Since modules are really just JavaScript files, a npm accessible module can include just about anything written in JS from
                          <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-core">Babel</a> (the popular ES6+ transpiler) and JS frameworks 
                          (<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react">React</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular">AngularJS</a> ) </p>
