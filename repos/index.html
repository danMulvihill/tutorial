            <p>  
                Before you use GitHub, you'll need to sign up for an account and log in. It's free as long as you agree to 
                allow your files to be publicly accessible. GitHub isn't always easy to navigate, but at least it isn't a command line interface.
                Luckily, there are a few procedures you will do most of the time.

                    <p>Git stores previous versions of your projects on your computer's hard drive, so if you mess up the latest version, you can recover previous versions.
                       GitHub stores your projects on GitHub's server, so if you mess up your computer, at least your projects will be safe.
                       To create a new repository, look for the skinny plus button on right side of the top nav menu after you logged in to your account.
                       GitHub does a good job of walking you through the process after that.

                        want to copy or "clone" someone else's project from their GitHub page rather than start your own. 
                        After you navigate to the repository on their page, look for the bright green button on the right side.
                        Copy the gitHub url shown and paste it after the git clone command with git.

                       You or someone else may work separately on a branch and request to merge 
                       the branch to the master branch at a later time. This is done through pull requests.

                            This is done essentially by creating a special repository with *.github.io url.
