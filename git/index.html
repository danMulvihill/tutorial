            <h1>Version Control (using Git)</h1>
            <p>Git is the most popular version control system. It works by storing
                repositories of your projects. The repositories contain hidden files
                for recovering previous versions of projects and alternative branches that
                can be restored if necessary. There is GUI version, but it is most often used on
                the command line interface (CLI). There are really very few commands and techniques
                that are used most of the time. Master these commands and look up the rest.
            </p>
