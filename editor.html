            <h1>Text / source code editor</h1>
            <p>Editoring tools like Atom provide a working enviroment for creating and editing the HTML, CSS, 
                and JavaScript files that are read by Web browsers. They are essentially descendants of the 
                IDEs, like Eclipse and Visual Studio, used for creating Java and .NET files, but scaled and 
                reconfigured for front-end development. Some of the features are built-in by default and some 
                are plug-ins that can easily be added on.

                    <p>Emmet is a very useful plug-in that is so popular that it often comes with most
                        editors by default. Emmet lets you write HTML using a convenient shorthand, 
                    which helps reduce a lot of tedious typing (and errors) </p>

                        <p>Many editors can understand HTML, CSS, and native JavaScript, and will provide
                            some prompting and suggestions for completing things attributes, CSS property values, 
                        and even funtion arguments, but to get this level of autocompletion to external libraries,
                    and other languages, you may need to install a plug-in </p>
