            <h1>Command Line Interface</h1>
            <p>The command line interface (CLI) is an ancient and relatively unfriendly technology, 
                yet it survives partially because no alternative has 
                been able to match it's speed and efficiency. 
                The CLI is essentiially the command center to the operating system (OS). 
                Computers may answer to different commands depending on their OS. 
                Linux is the dialect understood by most computers that 'serve' webpages.
                The MacOS is a little different but is close enough to Linux.
                Both are variations of Unix.
                If you are using a Windows OS, you are better off downloading a piece of software 
                known as <a href="https://gitforwindows.org">Git BASH</a>, that will allow you to replicate Unix commands.
                
                Although there is a small learning curve, once you do master a few
                techniques and commands, it will quickly become seemless and may
                improve your performance. There are really very few commands and techniques
                that are used most of the time. Master these commands and look up the rest.
