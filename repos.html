            <p>  
                GitHub isn't always easy to navigate, but at least it isn't a command line interface.
                Luckily, there are a few procedures you will do most of the time.

                    <p>git stores previous versions of your projects on your computer's hard drive, so if you mess up the latest version, you can recover previous versions.
                       GitHub stores your projects on GitHub's server, so if you mess up your computer, at least your projects will be safe.
                       To create a new repository, look for the bright green button on right side of the page after you logged in to your account.
                       GitHub does a good job of walking you through the process after that.

                       the branch to the master branch at a later time. This is done through pull requests.
